Installation Instructions
1. Create your Discord application (if you haven't: https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   - In your Discord application, head to the `Installation` tab and scroll down to `Guild Install`. Click `Scopes`, followed by `bot`. A dropdown with permissions will show up. Select `Send Messages` and `Attach Files` to ensure full bot functionality.
     
   - User installs are supported; if you want to use that, keep `User Install` enabled in `Installation Contexts`.
     
   - Make sure you have `Message Intents` enabled on the `Bot` page

2. Install Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/download (Highly recommended)
   > Windows, Linux, and macOS are supported
   
3. When opened, head to `File > Open Folder`. Select '`Whiskr`' inside the extracted `codebase.zip`
   > Make sure to download `codebase.zip` - Click on the file, then press the download button on the top left

4. Once you've opened the `Whiskr` folder inside `codebase` in VSC, fill in `config.env` with:
   - Your Discord bot token (Can be found in the `Bot` tab in your application)
   - Your TheCatAPI key (Get it here: https://thecatapi.com)

5. Head to `View > Terminal` on the top left. This will open a terminal on the bottom with a path to the folder you opened. If you set this up correctly, it should eventually lead to the `Whiskr` folder. **NOT** `codebase`.

6. Run this in the terminal box:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   This automatically installs every package in requirements.txt
   > Make sure you also have Python installed: https://www.python.org/

7. Select `main.py` on the VSC explorer. You should see a play button on the top left. Click that. If you set up everything correctly, the bot should start without problems.
   > You can always make other ways to start this bot; as long as it starts main.py, everything will work correctly.

Have fun! You're all set up 😺
